To run each of our code files ending with the "ipynb" extension, please spawn them in either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

If you run them on Google Colab, no packages will need to be installed as Google has them preinstalled. However, if you choose to run it locally with Jupyter Notebook (NOT RECOMMENDED), then you will have to install the required packages through Pip in a virtual environment.

Also, just to note, we are downloading our dataset to the ipynb files from the cloud, but in case of an error with that, we have still included the raw dataset file in the code folder for your convenience.

## Thank you for the wonderful semester!
